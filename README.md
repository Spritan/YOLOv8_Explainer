## Simplify your understanding of YOLOv8 Results
This is a package with state of the art methods for Explainable AI for computer vision using YOLOv8. This can be used for diagnosing model predictions, either in production or while developing models. The aim is also to serve as a benchmark of algorithms and metrics for research of new explainability methods.

### Install Environment & Dependencies

`YOLOv8-Explainer` can be seamlessly integrated into your projects with a straightforward installation process:

#### Installation as a Package

To incorporate `YOLOv8-Explainer` into your project as a dependency, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install YOLOv8-Explainer
```

## Features and Functionality

`YOLOv8-Explainer`  can be used to deploy various different CAM models for cutting-edge XAI methodologies in `YOLOv8` for images:

- GradCAM : Weight the 2D activations by the average gradient
- GradCAM + + : Like GradCAM but uses second order gradients
- XGradCAM : Like GradCAM but scale the gradients by the normalized activations
- EigenCAM : Takes the first principle component of the 2D Activations (no class discrimination, but seems to give great results)
- HiResCAM : Like GradCAM but element-wise multiply the activations with the gradients; provably guaranteed faithfulness for certain models
- LayerCAM : Spatially weight the activations by positive gradients. Works better especially in lower layers
- EigenGradCAM : Like EigenCAM but with class discrimination: First principle component of Activations*Grad. Looks like GradCAM, but cleaner

# Using from code as a library

```python

from YOLOv8_Explainer import yolov8_heatmap, display_images

model = yolov8_heatmap(
    weight="/location/model.pt", 
        conf_threshold=0.4,  
        method = "EigenCAM", 
        layer=[10, 12, 14, 16, 18, -3],
        ratio=0.02,
        show_box=True,
        renormalize=False,
)

imagelist = model(
    img_path="/location/image.jpg", 
    )

display_images(imagelist)

```

You can choose between the following CAM Models for version 0.0.5:

`GradCAM` , `HiResCAM`, `GradCAMPlusPlus`, `XGradCAM` , `LayerCAM`, `EigenGradCAM` and `EigenCAM`.

You can add a single image or a directory images to be used by the `Module`. The output will be a corresponding list of images (list contianing one PIL Image for a single image imput and list contining as many PIL images as Images in the input directory).
